# Roll-A-Dice
Roll-A-Dice a simple project in python. 
**Here's how to run your dice_roller_gui.py.py file:**

**1. Prerequisites**
Make sure you have Python installed (python --version should show 3.x).
Install the required library: Pillow (for image handling).
#bash/cmd
pip install pillow
**2. Prepare the Dice Images**
The code expects six PNG files: dice1.png through dice6.png in the same directory as your script.
If you don't have them, you can find free dice images online or quickly create blank ones for testing.

**3. Save and Run the Script**
Ensure your file is named dice_roller_gui.py.py (but consider renaming to just dice_roller_gui.py).
Open a terminal/command prompt at the script's location.
Run the script:
#bash/cmd
python dice_roller_gui.py.py
or
#bash/cmd/Tkinter
python dice_roller_gui.py
(depending on your filename)
